   - *Overview*

      This was an introduction to the processing program, which is used for creating visuals. It has two standard functions: setup() and draw(), and is written in java. This assignment didn't require any wiring; the code only created a colored window with a different colored circle on it that moved around the screen. The circle also changed color every time it touched the edge of the window.

      At first the code kept the direction and slope of the circle's movement constant, so it would only bounce from corner to corner. Then I used the java function Math.random() to make sure the circle moved a different way every time it hit a wall.
